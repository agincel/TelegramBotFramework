AdamBotFramework - A Python framework built on the python-telegram-bot and requests libraries.

This handles most of the work behind getting a bot up and running, and instead lets you simply start programming functions.

TO START:
Go into Telegram, and start a chat with BotFather
Create a new bot, and BotFather will tell you its token
Open apikey.csv and replace the dummy token with that token
If python is installed on your computer, navigate to this folder in cmd
run: "python telegram_bot.py"

The bot should start running.
